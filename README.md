This the source for the Racket package: "pkg-build".

This package builds all of the packages in a catalog using one or more
virtual machines. It is used by pkg-build.racket-lang.org to build the
main package catalog.

See the "examples" directory for instructions on how to run an
automated local build using Docker or using VirtualBox and Vagrant.
See the package documentation for all of the details.
